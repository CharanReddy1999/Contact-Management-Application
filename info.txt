AUTHENTICATION-


In Authentication, we are going to provide some endpoints which will help us a user to register
themselves and then login.

Once they login, they can use a acces token and with the help of access token
they can manage their contacts.

For this, first go to server.js file and create a routing first.

After that create a controller file and all the functions and logic under it so that in route
file it calls the function in controller.

Now we need to create a model which is type of acceptance basically the schema, for registring the user.
