AUTHENTICATION-


In Authentication, we are going to provide some endpoints which will help us a user to register
themselves and then login.

Once they login, they can use a acces token and with the help of access token
they can manage their contacts.

For this, first go to server.js file and create a routing first.

After that create a controller file and all the functions and logic under it so that in route
file it calls the function in controller.

Now we need to create a model which is type of acceptance basically the schema, for registring the user.


// we use bcrypt for password hashing

// JWT Access token and User Login

* JWT is known as JSON Web Token. It consists of 3 parts. Header which contains algorithm and type of.
Then comes the PAYLOAD, where it contains the user information. The last part is
signature verification.

after generating access token we can acces through the private routes.
